# .NET-Hospital-Database using SQL Server

Project: Medical Management Application
Developed a medical management application using C# and .NET framework designed to streamline the management of patient data and radiographic records. The application utilizes three main DataTables: Medics, Patients, and Radiographs, to organize and manage information efficiently.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Implemented a secure login system allowing doctors to access the application using their unique ID and password. This ensures that sensitive patient information is protected.

Data Management: Once authenticated, doctors can add new patients and input details about their radiographic examinations into the database, ensuring comprehensive patient records.

User Interface: Designed a user-friendly main form that displays tables containing all patients and their associated radiographs, enabling doctors to easily access and review patient data.

Database Integration: The application is connected to a relational database, facilitating seamless data storage and retrieval for patient and radiography records.

Data Organization: The use of DataTables for managing Medics, Patients, and Radiographs ensures that data is structured and accessible, enhancing the application's overall efficiency.

Technologies Used:
C# and .NET Framework: Core technologies for building the application, providing robust features and security.
Database Management: Utilized a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite) for data storage and management.
User Interface Design: Implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) that promotes ease of use for medical professionals.
